## Chinese BERT with Whole Word Masking
For further accelerating Chinese natural language processing, we provide **Chinese pre-trained BERT with Whole Word Masking**. Meanwhile, we also compare the state-of-the-art Chinese pre-trained models in depth, including [BERT](https://github.com/google-research/bert)、[ERNIE](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/LARK/tree/develop/ERNIE)、[BERT-wwm](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm)
